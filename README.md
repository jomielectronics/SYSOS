## Install Dependencies
***Important: If you wish not to install these dependencies, you can active the virtual environment with the dependencies already installed. To do so, run the following command (in the SYSOS directory): `source myenv/bin/activate`. Installing the dependencies after this is not necessary.***

### MAC / LINUX
In Mac or linux, run `bash Dependencies.sh`

## Usage
In your default CLI of choice, run `bash init.sh` in the `sysos/Unix` directory. Or, just run the following command: `python3 sysos.py`

## About
SYSOS contains new features that ***may not be stable, or fully worked out. Please don't expect it to work out of the box!*** If you do encounter any   
issues, do not hesitate to make a bug report.
